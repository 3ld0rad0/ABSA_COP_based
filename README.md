# ABSA_COP_based

ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) is a task used to identify specific aspects within a text and assign them a polarity (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive). My project focuses on this task within a particular context: COP, the annual conference on climate change.
Every year, people around the world express support or discontent regarding COP through social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). The main goal of this project is to collect and analyse these data to fine-tune a pre-trained model for ABSA, specifically within the Climate Change and COP domain.

The project consists of two main steps:

•	Step 1: Use Mistral to generate samples, which will serve as a training dataset for fine-tuning.

•	Step 2: Fine-tune a pre-trained model on the ABSA task within the COP domain.

Finally, the model was evaluated using a test set, also generated by Mistral.
