# ABSA_COP_based

ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) is a task used to identify specific aspects within a text and assign them a polarity (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive). My project focuses on this task within a particular context: COP, the annual conference on climate change.
Every year, people around the world express support or discontent regarding COP through social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). The main goal of this project is to collect and analyse these data to fine-tune a pre-trained model for ABSA, specifically within the Climate Change and COP domain.
